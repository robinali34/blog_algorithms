          <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>This post provides a detailed proof that the Spanning Tree with Exact Leaves problem is NP-complete by reducing from Rudrata Path. The problem asks whether a graph has a spanning tree whose set of leaves is precisely a given set L.</p>

<h2 id="problem-definitions">Problem Definitions</h2>

<h3 id="spanning-tree-with-exact-leaves-problem">Spanning Tree with Exact Leaves Problem</h3>

<p><strong>Input:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>An undirected graph G = (V, E)</li>
  <li>A set of nodes L ⊆ V</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Output:</strong> YES if G has a spanning tree such that its set of leaves is precisely the set L, NO otherwise.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The leaves of a tree are vertices of degree 1. The problem asks for a spanning tree where exactly the vertices in L are leaves, and all other vertices are not leaves.</p>

<h3 id="rudrata-path-problem">Rudrata Path Problem</h3>

<p><strong>Input:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>An undirected graph G = (V, E)</li>
  <li>Two vertices s, t ∈ V</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Output:</strong> YES if G contains a Rudrata (s,t)-path (path from s to t visiting all vertices exactly once), NO otherwise.</p>

<h2 id="1-np-completeness-proof-of-spanning-tree-with-l--v-leaves-solution-validation">1. NP-Completeness Proof of Spanning Tree with L ≤ V Leaves: Solution Validation</h2>

<h3 id="spanning-tree-with-exact-leaves--np">Spanning Tree with Exact Leaves ∈ NP</h3>

<p><strong>Verification Algorithm:</strong>
Given a candidate solution (spanning tree T):</p>
<ol>
  <li>Check that T is a tree: O(n) time (n-1 edges, connected)</li>
  <li>Check that T spans all vertices: O(n) time</li>
  <li>Identify leaves (vertices of degree 1): O(n) time</li>
  <li>Check that the set of leaves equals L: O(n) time</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Total Time:</strong> O(n), which is polynomial in input size.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Spanning Tree with Exact Leaves ∈ NP.</p>

<h2 id="2-reduce-rudrata-path-to-spanning-tree-with-exact-leaves">2. Reduce Rudrata Path to Spanning Tree with Exact Leaves</h2>

<p><strong>Key Insight:</strong> Given a Rudrata Path instance, we can reduce it to Spanning Tree with Exact Leaves by setting L = {s, t}. A Rudrata path has exactly 2 leaves (the endpoints s and t), and a spanning tree that is a path has exactly these two vertices as leaves.</p>

<p><strong>Hint:</strong> A path has exactly 2 leaves (the endpoints). A spanning tree that is a path has exactly 2 leaves: the start and end vertices. Therefore, finding a Rudrata (s,t)-path is equivalent to finding a spanning tree with leaves exactly {s, t}.</p>

<h3 id="21-input-conversion">2.1 Input Conversion</h3>

<p>Given a Rudrata Path instance (G, s, t) where G = (V, E) and we want a path from s to t visiting all vertices, we construct a Spanning Tree with Exact Leaves instance (G’, L).</p>

<p><strong>Construction:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Copy Graph</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>G’ = G (same graph, no changes)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Step 2: Set Leaf Set</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>L = {s, t} (we want a spanning tree with exactly s and t as leaves)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Step 3: Result</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Spanning Tree with Exact Leaves instance: (G’, {s, t})</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Detailed Example:</strong></p>

<p>Consider Rudrata Path instance:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Graph G with vertices {1, 2, 3, 4}</li>
  <li>Edges: {(1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (1,4)}</li>
  <li>s = 1, t = 4</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Transformation:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>G’ = G (same graph)</li>
  <li>L = {1, 4} (s = 1, t = 4)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Spanning Tree with Exact Leaves instance:</strong> (G’, {1, 4})</p>

<h3 id="22-output-conversion">2.2 Output Conversion</h3>

<p><strong>Given:</strong> Spanning Tree with Exact Leaves solution (spanning tree T with leaves exactly L = {s, t})</p>

<p><strong>Extract Rudrata Path:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Since T has exactly 2 leaves (s and t) and T is a tree on n vertices, T must be a path</li>
  <li>A tree with exactly 2 leaves is a path</li>
  <li>The path has endpoints s and t</li>
  <li>The path visits all vertices exactly once</li>
  <li>Therefore, T is a Rudrata (s,t)-path</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Verify Satisfaction:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>T is a spanning tree: ✓</li>
  <li>T has leaves exactly {s, t}: ✓ (by assumption)</li>
  <li>T is a path: ✓ (since it has exactly 2 leaves)</li>
  <li>The path visits all vertices: ✓ (since T is spanning)</li>
  <li>The path goes from s to t: ✓ (since s and t are the endpoints)</li>
  <li>Therefore, T is a Rudrata (s,t)-path: ✓</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="3-correctness-justification">3. Correctness Justification</h2>

<h3 id="31-if-rudrata-path-has-a-solution-then-spanning-tree-with-exact-leaves-has-a-solution">3.1 If Rudrata Path has a solution, then Spanning Tree with Exact Leaves has a solution</h3>

<p><strong>Given:</strong> Rudrata Path instance (G, s, t) has solution P (path from s to t visiting all vertices).</p>

<p><strong>Construct Spanning Tree Solution:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Use path P as the spanning tree T</li>
  <li>P visits all n vertices exactly once</li>
  <li>P has exactly 2 leaves: s and t</li>
  <li>P is a tree (connected, n-1 edges)</li>
  <li>Therefore, T = P is a spanning tree with leaves exactly {s, t} = L</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Verify Satisfaction:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>T spans all vertices: ✓ (since P visits all vertices)</li>
  <li>T is a tree: ✓ (path is a tree)</li>
  <li>T has leaves exactly {s, t}: ✓ (s and t are the endpoints, all other vertices have degree 2)</li>
  <li>Therefore, the set of leaves equals L = {s, t}: ✓</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Spanning Tree with Exact Leaves has a solution.</p>

<h3 id="32a-if-rudrata-path-does-not-have-a-solution-then-spanning-tree-with-exact-leaves-has-no-solution">3.2a If Rudrata Path does not have a solution, then Spanning Tree with Exact Leaves has no solution</h3>

<p><strong>Given:</strong> Rudrata Path instance (G, s, t) has no solution (no path from s to t visiting all vertices).</p>

<p><strong>Proof:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Assume:</strong> Spanning Tree with Exact Leaves instance (G’, {s, t}) has a solution (spanning tree T with leaves exactly {s, t}).</p>

<p><strong>Extract Path:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Since T has exactly 2 leaves (s and t) and T is a tree, T must be a path</li>
  <li>A tree with exactly 2 leaves is a path</li>
  <li>T has endpoints s and t</li>
  <li>T visits all n vertices exactly once</li>
  <li>T is a path from s to t in G’ = G</li>
  <li>Therefore, T is a Rudrata (s,t)-path</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Contradiction:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>T is a Rudrata (s,t)-path in G</li>
  <li>This contradicts the assumption that G has no Rudrata (s,t)-path</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Spanning Tree with Exact Leaves has no solution.</p>

<h3 id="32b-if-spanning-tree-with-exact-leaves-has-a-solution-then-rudrata-path-has-a-solution">3.2b If Spanning Tree with Exact Leaves has a solution, then Rudrata Path has a solution</h3>

<p><strong>Given:</strong> Spanning Tree with Exact Leaves instance (G’, {s, t}) has solution (spanning tree T with leaves exactly {s, t}).</p>

<p><strong>Extract Path:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Since T has exactly 2 leaves (s and t) and T is a tree, T must be a path</li>
  <li>A tree with exactly 2 leaves is a path</li>
  <li>T has endpoints s and t</li>
  <li>T visits all n vertices exactly once</li>
  <li>T is a path from s to t in G’ = G</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Verify Satisfaction:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Rudrata Path Requirements:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Path visits all n vertices exactly once: ✓ (since T is a path spanning all vertices)</li>
  <li>Path goes from s to t: ✓ (since s and t are the endpoints)</li>
  <li>All edges in path exist in G: ✓ (since T is a subgraph of G)</li>
  <li>Therefore, T is a Rudrata (s,t)-path</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Key Insight:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>A spanning tree with exactly 2 leaves is a path</li>
  <li>If the leaves are exactly {s, t}, then the path goes from s to t</li>
  <li>A path visiting all vertices from s to t is exactly a Rudrata (s,t)-path</li>
  <li>Therefore, any solution to Spanning Tree with Exact Leaves gives us a Rudrata (s,t)-path</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The spanning tree T forms a Rudrata (s,t)-path in G, so Rudrata Path has a solution.</p>

<h2 id="polynomial-time-analysis">Polynomial Time Analysis</h2>

<p><strong>Input Size:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Rudrata Path: Graph G with n vertices and m edges, vertices s and t</li>
  <li>Spanning Tree with Exact Leaves: Graph G’ with n vertices and m edges, set L = {s, t}</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Construction Time:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Copy graph G: O(n + m) time</li>
  <li>Set L = {s, t}: O(1) time</li>
  <li>Total: O(n + m) time</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Reduction is polynomial-time.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>We have shown:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Spanning Tree with Exact Leaves ∈ NP</strong>: Solutions can be verified in polynomial time</li>
  <li><strong>Rudrata Path ≤ₚ Spanning Tree with Exact Leaves</strong>: Polynomial-time reduction exists</li>
  <li><strong>Correctness</strong>: Rudrata Path has solution ↔ Spanning Tree with Exact Leaves has solution</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Therefore, Spanning Tree with Exact Leaves is NP-complete.</strong></p>

<h2 id="key-insights">Key Insights</h2>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Path Structure</strong>: A tree with exactly 2 leaves is a path</li>
  <li><strong>Spanning Property</strong>: A spanning tree that is a path visits all vertices exactly once</li>
  <li><strong>Exact Leaf Constraint</strong>: Requiring exactly {s, t} as leaves forces the path to go from s to t</li>
  <li><strong>Preservation</strong>: The reduction preserves the path structure through the exact leaf set constraint</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="practice-questions">Practice Questions</h2>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Modify the reduction</strong> to reduce Rudrata Cycle to Spanning Tree with Exact Leaves. What set L would you use?</li>
  <li><strong>Extend the reduction</strong> to handle directed graphs. How would the reduction change?</li>
  <li><strong>Consider weighted versions:</strong> How would you reduce weighted Rudrata Path to weighted Spanning Tree?</li>
  <li><strong>Prove the reverse reduction:</strong> Can we reduce Spanning Tree with Exact Leaves to Rudrata Path? How?</li>
  <li><strong>Investigate special cases:</strong> For what sets L is the problem polynomial-time solvable?</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<p>This reduction demonstrates how structural constraints (number of leaves) can capture path properties, enabling reductions between path-finding and tree problems.</p>

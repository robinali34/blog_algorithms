          <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>This post provides a detailed proof that the Reliable Network problem is NP-complete by reducing from Rudrata Cycle. Reliable Network asks for a graph that satisfies connectivity requirements within a budget, generalizing the Hamiltonian cycle problem.</p>

<h2 id="problem-definitions">Problem Definitions</h2>

<h3 id="reliable-network-problem">Reliable Network Problem</h3>

<p><strong>Input:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Two n × n matrices:
    <ul>
      <li>Distance matrix d_ij (cost of edge between vertices i and j)</li>
      <li>Connectivity requirement matrix r_ij (required number of vertex-disjoint paths between i and j)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A budget b ≥ 0</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Output:</strong> YES if there exists a graph G = ({1, 2, …, n}, E) such that:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The total cost of all edges is b or less: ∑_{(i,j) ∈ E} d_ij ≤ b</li>
  <li>Between any two distinct vertices i and j, there are r_ij vertex-disjoint paths</li>
</ol>

<p>NO otherwise.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Vertex-disjoint paths are paths that share no vertices except possibly their endpoints.</p>

<h3 id="rudrata-cycle-problem">Rudrata Cycle Problem</h3>

<p><strong>Input:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>An undirected graph G = (V, E)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Output:</strong> YES if G contains a Rudrata cycle (Hamiltonian cycle visiting all vertices exactly once), NO otherwise.</p>

<h2 id="1-np-completeness-proof-of-reliable-network-solution-validation">1. NP-Completeness Proof of Reliable Network: Solution Validation</h2>

<h3 id="reliable-network--np">Reliable Network ∈ NP</h3>

<p><strong>Verification Algorithm:</strong>
Given a candidate solution (graph G = ({1, 2, …, n}, E)):</p>
<ol>
  <li>Check that total cost ≤ b: O(<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">|E|</code>) time</li>
  <li>For each pair (i, j) with i ≠ j:
    <ul>
      <li>Find r_ij vertex-disjoint paths: O(n²) time using max-flow algorithms</li>
      <li>Check that at least r_ij paths exist: O(n²) time</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Check all pairs: O(n⁴) time</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Total Time:</strong> O(n⁴), which is polynomial in input size.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Reliable Network ∈ NP.</p>

<h2 id="2-reduce-rudrata-cycle-to-reliable-network">2. Reduce Rudrata Cycle to Reliable Network</h2>

<p><strong>Key Insight:</strong> Given a Rudrata Cycle instance, we can reduce it to Reliable Network by setting all distances to 1 or 2, all connectivity requirements to 2, and budget to n. A graph with n vertices, n edges, cost ≤ n, and 2 vertex-disjoint paths between all pairs must be a cycle, which is exactly a Rudrata cycle.</p>

<p><strong>Hint:</strong> If all d_ij’s are 1 or 2, b = n, and all r_ij’s are 2, then we need a graph with exactly n edges (each of cost 1) that is 2-connected. A cycle on n vertices has exactly n edges and provides 2 vertex-disjoint paths between any two vertices (going clockwise and counterclockwise).</p>

<h3 id="21-input-conversion">2.1 Input Conversion</h3>

<p>Given a Rudrata Cycle instance G = (V, E) with n vertices, we construct a Reliable Network instance (d, r, b).</p>

<p><strong>Construction:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Set Distance Matrix</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>For each pair (i, j) with i ≠ j:
    <ul>
      <li>If (i, j) ∈ E: d_ij = 1 (edge exists in original graph)</li>
      <li>If (i, j) ∉ E: d_ij = 2 (edge doesn’t exist, higher cost)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>d_ii = 0 (no self-loops)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Step 2: Set Connectivity Requirements</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>For all pairs (i, j) with i ≠ j: r_ij = 2</li>
  <li>r_ii = 0 (no requirement for same vertex)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Step 3: Set Budget</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>b = n (we can afford exactly n edges of cost 1)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Step 4: Result</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Reliable Network instance: (d, r, n) where:
    <ul>
      <li>d_ij ∈ {1, 2} for all i ≠ j</li>
      <li>r_ij = 2 for all i ≠ j</li>
      <li>b = n</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Detailed Example:</strong></p>

<p>Consider Rudrata Cycle instance:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Graph G with vertices {1, 2, 3, 4}</li>
  <li>Edges: {(1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (4,1)}</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Transformation:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Distance matrix d:
    <ul>
      <li>d₁₂ = d₂₃ = d₃₄ = d₄₁ = 1 (edges exist)</li>
      <li>All other d_ij = 2 (edges don’t exist)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Connectivity matrix r:
    <ul>
      <li>r_ij = 2 for all i ≠ j</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Budget: b = 4</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Reliable Network instance:</strong> (d, r, 4)</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> A cycle on 4 vertices has 4 edges (cost 4) and provides 2 vertex-disjoint paths between any pair.</p>

<h3 id="22-output-conversion">2.2 Output Conversion</h3>

<p><strong>Given:</strong> Reliable Network solution (graph G’ = ({1, 2, …, n}, E’) with cost ≤ n and r_ij = 2 vertex-disjoint paths between all pairs)</p>

<p><strong>Extract Rudrata Cycle:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Since b = n and all edges cost at least 1, G’ has exactly n edges, all of cost 1</li>
  <li>Since r_ij = 2 for all pairs, G’ is 2-connected</li>
  <li>A 2-connected graph with n vertices and n edges must be a cycle</li>
  <li>Therefore, G’ is a cycle visiting all n vertices exactly once (a Rudrata cycle)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Verify Satisfaction:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>G’ visits all n vertices: ✓ (by construction)</li>
  <li>G’ forms a cycle: ✓ (2-connected with n vertices and n edges)</li>
  <li>All edges in G’ exist in original graph G: ✓ (since d_ij = 1 only for edges in G)</li>
  <li>Therefore, G’ is a Rudrata cycle in G</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="3-correctness-justification">3. Correctness Justification</h2>

<h3 id="31-if-rudrata-cycle-has-a-solution-then-reliable-network-has-a-solution">3.1 If Rudrata Cycle has a solution, then Reliable Network has a solution</h3>

<p><strong>Given:</strong> Rudrata Cycle instance G has solution C (Hamiltonian cycle).</p>

<p><strong>Construct Reliable Network Solution:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Use cycle C as the graph G’</li>
  <li>G’ has exactly n edges (one per vertex in the cycle)</li>
  <li>All edges in C have cost 1 (since they exist in G, so d_ij = 1)</li>
  <li>Total cost = n ≤ b = n ✓</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Verify Connectivity:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>For any two vertices i and j in the cycle:
    <ul>
      <li>Path 1: Follow the cycle in one direction from i to j</li>
      <li>Path 2: Follow the cycle in the other direction from i to j</li>
      <li>These two paths are vertex-disjoint (except at endpoints)</li>
      <li>Therefore, there are 2 vertex-disjoint paths between i and j ✓</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>All connectivity requirements r_ij = 2 are satisfied</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Reliable Network has a solution.</p>

<h3 id="32a-if-rudrata-cycle-does-not-have-a-solution-then-reliable-network-has-no-solution">3.2a If Rudrata Cycle does not have a solution, then Reliable Network has no solution</h3>

<p><strong>Given:</strong> Rudrata Cycle instance G has no solution (no Hamiltonian cycle).</p>

<p><strong>Proof:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Assume:</strong> Reliable Network instance (d, r, n) has a solution (graph G’ with cost ≤ n and 2 vertex-disjoint paths between all pairs).</p>

<p><strong>Extract Cycle:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Since b = n and all edges cost at least 1, G’ has at most n edges</li>
  <li>Since r_ij = 2 for all pairs, G’ is 2-connected</li>
  <li>A 2-connected graph with n vertices needs at least n edges (by connectivity requirements)</li>
  <li>Therefore, G’ has exactly n edges, all of cost 1</li>
  <li>A 2-connected graph with n vertices and exactly n edges must be a cycle</li>
  <li>Therefore, G’ is a cycle on n vertices</li>
  <li>Since all edges have cost 1, all edges in G’ exist in the original graph G</li>
  <li>Therefore, G’ is a Rudrata cycle in G</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Contradiction:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>G’ is a Rudrata cycle in G</li>
  <li>This contradicts the assumption that G has no Rudrata cycle</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Reliable Network has no solution.</p>

<h3 id="32b-if-reliable-network-has-a-solution-then-rudrata-cycle-has-a-solution">3.2b If Reliable Network has a solution, then Rudrata Cycle has a solution</h3>

<p><strong>Given:</strong> Reliable Network instance (d, r, n) has solution (graph G’ with cost ≤ n and 2 vertex-disjoint paths between all pairs).</p>

<p><strong>Extract Cycle:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Since b = n and all edges cost at least 1, G’ has at most n edges</li>
  <li>Since r_ij = 2 for all pairs, G’ is 2-connected</li>
  <li>A 2-connected graph with n vertices needs at least n edges</li>
  <li>Therefore, G’ has exactly n edges, all of cost 1</li>
  <li>A 2-connected graph with n vertices and exactly n edges must be a cycle</li>
  <li>Since all edges have cost 1, they correspond to edges in the original graph G (where d_ij = 1)</li>
  <li>Therefore, G’ is a cycle in G visiting all n vertices</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Verify Satisfaction:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Rudrata Cycle Requirements:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>G’ visits all n vertices: ✓ (by construction, G’ = ({1, 2, …, n}, E’))</li>
  <li>G’ forms a cycle: ✓ (2-connected with n vertices and n edges)</li>
  <li>All edges in G’ exist in G: ✓ (since d_ij = 1 only for edges in G)</li>
  <li>Therefore, G’ is a Rudrata cycle in G</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Key Insight:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>With budget b = n and all edges costing at least 1, we can afford exactly n edges</li>
  <li>Requiring r_ij = 2 vertex-disjoint paths between all pairs forces the graph to be 2-connected</li>
  <li>A 2-connected graph with n vertices and n edges must be a cycle</li>
  <li>A cycle provides exactly 2 vertex-disjoint paths between any two vertices (clockwise and counterclockwise)</li>
  <li>Therefore, any solution to Reliable Network gives us a Rudrata cycle</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The graph G’ forms a Rudrata cycle in G, so Rudrata Cycle has a solution.</p>

<h2 id="polynomial-time-analysis">Polynomial Time Analysis</h2>

<p><strong>Input Size:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Rudrata Cycle: Graph G with n vertices and m edges</li>
  <li>Reliable Network: Two n × n matrices (n² entries each), integer b = n</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Construction Time:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Create distance matrix: O(n²) time (check each pair)</li>
  <li>Create connectivity matrix: O(n²) time (set all r_ij = 2)</li>
  <li>Set b = n: O(1) time</li>
  <li>Total: O(n²) time</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Reduction is polynomial-time.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>We have shown:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Reliable Network ∈ NP</strong>: Solutions can be verified in polynomial time</li>
  <li><strong>Rudrata Cycle ≤ₚ Reliable Network</strong>: Polynomial-time reduction exists</li>
  <li><strong>Correctness</strong>: Rudrata Cycle has solution ↔ Reliable Network has solution</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Therefore, Reliable Network is NP-complete.</strong></p>

<h2 id="key-insights">Key Insights</h2>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Budget Constraint</strong>: Setting b = n with all edges costing at least 1 forces exactly n edges</li>
  <li><strong>Connectivity Requirement</strong>: Requiring r_ij = 2 vertex-disjoint paths forces 2-connectivity</li>
  <li><strong>Cycle Characterization</strong>: A 2-connected graph with n vertices and n edges must be a cycle</li>
  <li><strong>Path Structure</strong>: A cycle provides exactly 2 vertex-disjoint paths between any two vertices</li>
  <li><strong>Cost Encoding</strong>: Using d_ij = 1 for existing edges and d_ij = 2 for non-existing edges ensures only original edges are used</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="practice-questions">Practice Questions</h2>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Modify the reduction</strong> to handle different connectivity requirements. What if r_ij varies?</li>
  <li><strong>Extend the reduction</strong> to handle weighted graphs. How would you set the distance matrix?</li>
  <li><strong>Consider the optimization version:</strong> How would you reduce the optimization version of Rudrata Cycle to Reliable Network?</li>
  <li><strong>Prove the reverse reduction:</strong> Can we reduce Reliable Network to Rudrata Cycle? How?</li>
  <li><strong>Investigate special cases:</strong> For what values of r_ij and b is Reliable Network polynomial-time solvable?</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<p>This reduction demonstrates how connectivity and budget constraints can encode Hamiltonian cycle requirements, enabling reductions between network design and cycle-finding problems.</p>

          <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>This post provides a detailed proof that the Maximum Common Subgraph problem is NP-complete by reducing from Clique. Maximum Common Subgraph asks for sets of nodes to delete from two graphs such that the remaining graphs are identical and each has at least b nodes.</p>

<h2 id="problem-definitions">Problem Definitions</h2>

<h3 id="maximum-common-subgraph-problem">Maximum Common Subgraph Problem</h3>

<p><strong>Input:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Two graphs G₁ = (V₁, E₁) and G₂ = (V₂, E₂)</li>
  <li>A budget b ≥ 0</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Output:</strong> YES if there exist two sets of nodes V₁’ ⊆ V₁ and V₂’ ⊆ V₂ whose deletion leaves at least b nodes in each graph, and makes the two graphs identical (isomorphic), NO otherwise.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> After deleting V₁’ from G₁ and V₂’ from G₂, the remaining graphs must be isomorphic and each must have at least b vertices.</p>

<h3 id="clique-problem">Clique Problem</h3>

<p><strong>Input:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>An undirected graph G = (V, E)</li>
  <li>Integer k ≥ 1</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Output:</strong> YES if G contains a clique of size k (set of k vertices, all pairwise adjacent), NO otherwise.</p>

<h3 id="maximum-common-subgraph--np">Maximum Common Subgraph ∈ NP</h3>

<p><strong>Verification Algorithm:</strong>
Given a candidate solution (sets V₁’ ⊆ V₁ and V₂’ ⊆ V₂):</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <table>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Check that</td>
          <td>V₁ \ V₁’</td>
          <td>≥ b: O(1) time</td>

          <td>≥ b: O(1) time</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </li>
  <li>Construct remaining graphs G₁’ and G₂’ by deleting V₁’ and V₂’: O(n₁ + n₂ + m₁ + m₂) time</li>
  <li>Check that G₁’ and G₂’ are isomorphic: O(n²) time using graph isomorphism algorithms</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Total Time:</strong> O(n²), which is polynomial in input size.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Maximum Common Subgraph ∈ NP.</p>

<h2 id="2-reduce-clique-to-maximum-common-subgraph">2. Reduce Clique to Maximum Common Subgraph</h2>

<p><strong>Key Insight:</strong> Given a Clique instance, we can reduce it to Maximum Common Subgraph by setting G₁ = G (the original graph) and G₂ = K_k (the complete graph on k vertices). Then G has a k-clique if and only if we can delete nodes from G₁ to make it isomorphic to K_k, which means the remaining subgraph is a k-clique.</p>

<p><strong>Hint:</strong> If we set G₂ = K_k and b = k, then finding sets V₁’ and V₂’ such that the remaining graphs are identical means finding a subgraph of G₁ isomorphic to K_k. Since K_k is a complete graph on k vertices, this is exactly a k-clique.</p>

<h3 id="21-input-conversion">2.1 Input Conversion</h3>

<p>Given a Clique instance (G, k) where G = (V, E) with n vertices, we construct a Maximum Common Subgraph instance (G₁, G₂, b).</p>

<p><strong>Construction:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Set First Graph</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>G₁ = G (the original graph)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Step 2: Set Second Graph</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>G₂ = K_k (complete graph on k vertices)</li>
  <li>V₂ = {1, 2, …, k}</li>
  <li>E₂ = {(i, j) : 1 ≤ i &lt; j ≤ k} (all pairs are adjacent)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Step 3: Set Budget</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>b = k (we want at least k nodes remaining in each graph)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Step 4: Result</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Maximum Common Subgraph instance: (G₁, G₂, k) where G₁ = G and G₂ = K_k</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Detailed Example:</strong></p>

<p>Consider Clique instance:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Graph G with vertices {1, 2, 3, 4}</li>
  <li>Edges: {(1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4)}</li>
  <li>k = 3 (want clique of size 3)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Transformation:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>G₁ = G (same graph)</li>
  <li>G₂ = K₃ (complete graph on 3 vertices)
    <ul>
      <li>Vertices: {a, b, c}</li>
      <li>Edges: {(a,b), (a,c), (b,c)}</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>b = 3</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Maximum Common Subgraph instance:</strong> (G₁, K₃, 3)</p>

<h3 id="22-output-conversion">2.2 Output Conversion</h3>

<p><strong>Given:</strong> Maximum Common Subgraph solution (sets V₁’ ⊆ V₁ and V₂’ ⊆ V₂ such that after deletion, graphs are identical and each has at least b = k nodes)</p>

<p><strong>Extract Clique:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Since G₂ = K_k has exactly k vertices, we must delete V₂’ = ∅ (delete nothing)</li>
  <li>The remaining graph G₁’ (after deleting V₁’) must be isomorphic to K_k</li>
  <li>Since K_k is a complete graph on k vertices, G₁’ is a k-clique</li>
  <li>The vertices of G₁’ form a clique of size k in G</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Verify Satisfaction:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>G₁’ has k vertices: ✓ (since isomorphic to K_k)</li>
  <li>All pairs of vertices in G₁’ are adjacent: ✓ (since G₁’ is isomorphic to K_k, which is complete)</li>
  <li>Therefore, G₁’ is a clique of size k in G</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="31-if-clique-has-a-solution-then-maximum-common-subgraph-has-a-solution">3.1 If Clique has a solution, then Maximum Common Subgraph has a solution</h3>

<p><strong>Given:</strong> Clique instance (G, k) has solution C (clique of size k).</p>

<p><strong>Construct Maximum Common Subgraph Solution:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Let G₁’ be the subgraph of G₁ = G induced by vertices in C</li>
  <li>Since C is a clique, G₁’ is isomorphic to K_k</li>
  <li>Set V₁’ = V₁ \ C (delete all vertices not in the clique)</li>
  <li>Set V₂’ = ∅ (delete nothing from K_k, since it already has exactly k vertices)</li>
  <li>After deletion:
    <ul>
      <li>G₁’ has k vertices and is isomorphic to K_k</li>
      <li>G₂’ = G₂ = K_k (unchanged)</li>
      <li>Both graphs are isomorphic (both are K_k)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Verify Satisfaction:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">|V₁ \ V₁'|</code> = <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">|C|</code> = k ≥ b = k: ✓</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">|V₂ \ V₂'|</code> = <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">|V₂|</code> = k ≥ b = k: ✓</li>
  <li>G₁’ is isomorphic to G₂’: ✓ (both are K_k)</li>
  <li>Therefore, the solution is valid</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Maximum Common Subgraph has a solution.</p>

<h3 id="32a-if-clique-does-not-have-a-solution-then-maximum-common-subgraph-has-no-solution">3.2a If Clique does not have a solution, then Maximum Common Subgraph has no solution</h3>

<p><strong>Given:</strong> Clique instance (G, k) has no solution (no clique of size k).</p>

<p><strong>Proof:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Assume:</strong> Maximum Common Subgraph instance (G₁, G₂, k) where G₁ = G and G₂ = K_k has a solution (sets V₁’, V₂’).</p>

<p><strong>Extract Clique:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Since G₂ = K_k has exactly k vertices, to have at least k vertices remaining, we must have V₂’ = ∅</li>
  <li>Therefore, G₂’ = G₂ = K_k (unchanged)</li>
  <li>G₁’ (after deleting V₁’) must be isomorphic to G₂’ = K_k</li>
  <li>Since G₁’ is isomorphic to K_k, it is a complete graph on k vertices</li>
  <li>Therefore, G₁’ is a k-clique in G₁ = G</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Contradiction:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>G₁’ is a k-clique in G</li>
  <li>This contradicts the assumption that G has no k-clique</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Maximum Common Subgraph has no solution.</p>

<h3 id="32b-if-maximum-common-subgraph-has-a-solution-then-clique-has-a-solution">3.2b If Maximum Common Subgraph has a solution, then Clique has a solution</h3>

<p><strong>Given:</strong> Maximum Common Subgraph instance (G₁, G₂, k) where G₁ = G and G₂ = K_k has solution (sets V₁’, V₂’).</p>

<p><strong>Extract Clique:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Since G₂ = K_k has exactly k vertices, to have at least k vertices remaining, we must have V₂’ = ∅</li>
  <li>Therefore, G₂’ = G₂ = K_k</li>
  <li>G₁’ (after deleting V₁’) must be isomorphic to G₂’ = K_k</li>
  <li>Since G₁’ is isomorphic to K_k, it is a complete graph on k vertices</li>
  <li>The vertices of G₁’ form a clique of size k in G₁ = G</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Verify Satisfaction:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Clique Requirements:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>G₁’ has exactly k vertices: ✓ (since isomorphic to K_k)</li>
  <li>All pairs of vertices in G₁’ are adjacent: ✓ (since G₁’ is isomorphic to K_k, which is complete)</li>
  <li>Therefore, G₁’ is a clique of size k in G</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Key Insight:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Setting G₂ = K_k forces the common subgraph to be K_k</li>
  <li>Finding a subgraph of G₁ isomorphic to K_k is exactly finding a k-clique</li>
  <li>The budget b = k ensures we keep exactly k vertices (since K_k has k vertices)</li>
  <li>Therefore, any solution to Maximum Common Subgraph gives us a k-clique</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The subgraph G₁’ forms a clique of size k in G, so Clique has a solution.</p>

<h2 id="polynomial-time-analysis">Polynomial Time Analysis</h2>

<p><strong>Input Size:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Clique: Graph G with n vertices and m edges, integer k</li>
  <li>Maximum Common Subgraph: Graph G₁ with n vertices and m edges, graph G₂ = K_k with k vertices and k(k-1)/2 edges, budget b = k</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Construction Time:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Set G₁ = G: O(1) time</li>
  <li>Create K_k: O(k²) time (k vertices, k(k-1)/2 edges)</li>
  <li>Set b = k: O(1) time</li>
  <li>Total: O(k²) time</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Reduction is polynomial-time.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>We have shown:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Maximum Common Subgraph ∈ NP</strong>: Solutions can be verified in polynomial time</li>
  <li><strong>Clique ≤ₚ Maximum Common Subgraph</strong>: Polynomial-time reduction exists</li>
  <li><strong>Correctness</strong>: Clique has solution ↔ Maximum Common Subgraph has solution</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Therefore, Maximum Common Subgraph is NP-complete.</strong></p>

<h2 id="key-insights">Key Insights</h2>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Pattern Graph</strong>: Using K_k as G₂ forces the common subgraph to be a k-clique</li>
  <li><strong>Isomorphism Constraint</strong>: Requiring the graphs to be identical after deletion forces G₁’ to be isomorphic to K_k</li>
  <li><strong>Budget Constraint</strong>: Setting b = k ensures we keep exactly k vertices</li>
  <li><strong>Clique Characterization</strong>: A subgraph isomorphic to K_k is exactly a k-clique</li>
  <li><strong>Preservation</strong>: The reduction preserves the clique structure through isomorphism requirements</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="practice-questions">Practice Questions</h2>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Modify the reduction</strong> to reduce Independent Set to Maximum Common Subgraph. What would you use as G₂?</li>
  <li><strong>Extend the reduction</strong> to handle weighted graphs. How would you modify the problem?</li>
  <li><strong>Consider the optimization version:</strong> How would you reduce the optimization version of Clique to Maximum Common Subgraph?</li>
  <li><strong>Prove the reverse reduction:</strong> Can we reduce Maximum Common Subgraph to Clique? How?</li>
  <li><strong>Investigate special cases:</strong> For what graph classes is Maximum Common Subgraph polynomial-time solvable?</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<p>This reduction demonstrates how graph isomorphism constraints can encode clique-finding requirements, enabling reductions between subgraph matching and clique problems.</p>
